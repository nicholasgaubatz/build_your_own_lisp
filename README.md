This is my first project in C, inspired by [Daniel Holden's Build Your Own Lisp](https://buildyourownlisp.com/). As of the beginning of this project, I have very little knowledge of C. My goal is to increase my understanding of C and learn how to make projects.

In each file I implement a few interesting "Bonus Mark" solutions, based on problems posed at the end of each chapter.
